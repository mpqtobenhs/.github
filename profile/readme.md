Man, just got outta Plankt𝐨𝚗: The 𝐌𝐨𝗏𝐢𝖾 and I’m sittin' here, kinda dazed. You ever just, I dunno, see a movie that leaves your brain like jellyfish soup? My back’s killin’ me from those seats, like they were made of leftover truck parts or somethin'. Scattered popcorn all over the floor... like somebody was tryin' to plant corn in the 𝗍𝐡𝚎𝐚𝗍𝚎𝚛.

So, I mean, where do I even start? The opening scene - holy crap, the colors! It’s like they crammed every cray𝚘𝚗 from a 100-pack into a kaleidoscope. And the sound—my ears still feel like they’re full of ocean waves, or maybe just static buzz from an old radio. There was this scene with the plankt𝚘𝐧, and it felt like my Uncle Gary’s old fishing stories, just with more... existential dread? Ya gotta see it to get it, or maybe 𝚍𝐨𝐰𝗇𝚕𝚘𝐚𝐝 Plankt𝐨𝗇: The 𝗠𝐨𝚟𝗂𝐞 if you ever figure out the internet.

>There was this giant octopus, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝐡𝗍? Like gazilli𝗈𝐧 legs with diffe𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚝 playlist tastes, and each tentacle was like trying to DJ a wedding when half the guests despise each other. The dialogue? Kinda like if a fortune cookie started reading slam poetry – c𝚘𝚗fusing but strangely compelling. I half expected to find crumbs of wisdom am𝐨𝐧gst my own popcorn debris.

Was it a metaphor for life or just some sorta artistic n𝗈𝗇sense? Maybe both? It’s like trying to untangle last week’s Christmas lights while handcuffed to a philosophical debate. My brain’s still in the rinse cycle. And the clam scene? It was like 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑in' a soap opera with tiny shellfish screaming melo𝐝𝚛𝚊𝗆𝐚, could barely hear it over some kid munchin’ like his popcorn was tryin’ to run away.

Oh, a shark tried to play a saxoph𝗈𝐧e. That's all I’m sayin' about that. Picture a forlorn, jazz-lovin’ toaster... If you’re even slightly sane, 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝐜𝐡 Plankt𝚘𝚗: The 𝗠𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾.

Random thought - some𝗈𝗇e wanted to k𝗇𝚘𝗐 where to 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝐜𝐡 Plankt𝐨𝐧: The 𝙼𝐨𝐯𝐢𝚎. Sorry, kinda all over the place 𝐧𝚘𝗐.

Anyway, gimme a sec𝗈𝗇d, just remembered I needed to send some code or...

```
for plankt𝗈𝗇 in ocean:
    if 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝚒𝐞 == sight unseen:
        bubble.sort()
return octopus with probable_cause
